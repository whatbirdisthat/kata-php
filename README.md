# PHP TDD Kata

## Preparing for a workshop in PHP practice

Test Driven Development in PHP is long-established and mature.
Here is a simple exercise to prove that you can write test-driven
code and not have any reliance on frameworks, IDEs or
basically anything.

This kata is produced using a little php docker magic -
but that's just to keep my laptop clean (and so other people
don't have to install php if they don't want it etc)

I am editing the code with `vim` - but you could use gedit, kate
notepad (noooo-tpad!) ... this exercise is to focus
one's attention **purely** on the code, and the problem
we're trying to solve with the code.
